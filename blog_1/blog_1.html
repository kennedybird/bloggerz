            <h2>Cards for Special Occasions</h2>
       
       
            <p> Making cards for people I love is my favorite. Often, and in the case of this card, I think it's really fun to create a multidimensional look by using different pieces and gluing them onto one card. For this one, I water colored the base of the card and then drew out the little pieces using a black pen and then water colored over it. Sometimes I can draw characters just from thinking of them but sometimes and in the case of this card I take inspiration from pinterest! Once I had done that, I glued them all onto my card! This craft is super fun but can take a while! </p>

            <h2>Collaging</h2>
       
       
            <p> For this craft a bunch of friends and I got together and brought out vintage LIFE magazines to cut and glue from. For this one, I chose this lovely lady and decided to make her a new skirt and top. I then used mod podge to stick all of the pieces to the cardstock. Collaging is so fun. I really recommend this craft if you don't know where to start. Old magazines are gems for this. </p>

            <h2>Mix of Block Printing & Water Color </h2>
       
       
            <p> For this craft you kind of need some additional materials that not everyone might have laying around. However I think block printing can be done in a number of ways. For example, painting on an object like a leaf then pressing it onto paper. 

            For this crafting session however I used a ink and a printing block to create my little fairy and then while that was drying I painted some little embellishments using watercolor and later glued those on once the block print dried.

            This craft is fun if you have the time! It does require acrylic paint and water color paint though and it can be time consuming so that is a downside. Super fun though!
